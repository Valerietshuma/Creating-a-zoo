# Valerietshuma - Creating a Zoo

Welcome to the "Creating a Zoo" project! This project is designed to simulate a zoo environment where various animals, such as Dolphins, Penguins, and Tigers, exhibit behaviors like eating, swimming, and walking. The project follows object-oriented programming principles in Java to demonstrate inheritance, interfaces, and class structures.


### Files Description:

- **creating-a-zoo.iml**: The IntelliJ IDEA project configuration file.
- **src/**: This folder contains all the Java source code files.

### Java Classes and Interfaces:

- **Animal.java**: A base class that defines common properties and behaviors for all animals.
- **Dolphin.java**: A subclass of `Animal`, representing the Dolphin animal, which can swim and eat.
- **Eat.java**: An interface representing the behavior of eating, which is implemented by animals that can eat.
- **Main.java**: The entry point of the program where the zoo is created and animal behaviors are simulated.
- **Penguin.java**: A subclass of `Animal`, representing the Penguin animal, which can walk and swim.
- **Swim.java**: An interface representing the behavior of swimming, implemented by animals that can swim.
- **Tiger.java**: A subclass of `Animal`, representing the Tiger animal, which can walk and eat.
- **Walk.java**: An interface representing the behavior of walking, implemented by animals that can walk.

## Key Features

- **Inheritance**: Subclasses like `Dolphin`, `Penguin`, and `Tiger` inherit common features from the `Animal` class.
- **Interfaces**: The `Eat`, `Swim`, and `Walk` interfaces are implemented by relevant animals, ensuring polymorphic behavior.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project uses encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure the zoo simulation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Java** installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

2. Clone the repository or download the project files.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/valerietshuma-creating-a-zoo.git
